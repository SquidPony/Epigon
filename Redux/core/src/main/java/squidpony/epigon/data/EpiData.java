/**
 * Data class for information shared by all data objects.
 * <br>
 * Every EpiData has a unique int in a field called {@link #idHash}. Unless more than 2 to the 32 EpiData are created,
 * which is basically impossible due to memory constraints unless some EpiData values are constantly created and
 * destroyed, this number will never repeat. This may be useful for some purposes; it is used as a more-controlled
 * identity hash in the {@link #hashCode()} implementation here. Subclasses that want to compare EpiData by value should
 * not call {@code super.equals()} or {@code super.hashCode()} but may compare and hash {@link #name} and/or
 * {@link #description}.
 * <br>
 * Acts as an IRNG that stores its own state for its own random number generation, allowing the game to avoid relying so
 * heavily on the order in which a static RNG generates numbers for various purposes. The random number generation
 * algorithm this uses is "QuixoticRNG" from tommyettinger's Sarong project, which may go into SquidLib if it passes
 * 32TB of tests (it has already passed 16TB with no failures). QuixoticRNG is really really fast, uses only one long of
 * state, and seems rather solid on the tests that have been run (two "unusual" anomalies, both barely considered
 * significant enough to note, and no anomalies after 64GB).
