/**
 * This class represents a type of body that some creature might have.
 *
 * The internal class BodyPartBlueprint is used to create a graph of the body.
 *
 * If a critical body part is destroyed, then the creature dies. If a critical
 * part is part of a creature that becomes detached from the primary part then
 * the creature dies.
 *
 * The clothing, jewelry, and equip slot lists must contain only BodyParts that
 * are defined for this BodyBlueprint. The Integer portions of these indicate
 * how many of such items may occupy the given body part.
 *
 * When subclassing a Body the children can only add to the body, not remove.
