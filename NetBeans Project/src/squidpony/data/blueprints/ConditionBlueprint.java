/**
 * Blueprint for a Condition.
 *
 * The element associated with a Condition is inherited from the Effect that
 * applied it.
 *
 * Conditions are temporary (although perhaps indefinite) and can cause any
 * action to be indeterminately applied (such as stat and maximum energy changes
 * and ability availability) or applied on a frequency basis (such as energy
 * damage/healing or movement).
 *
 * When the condition wears off or is canceled there may be some list of actions
 * that take place. Being suppressed does not count as canceled, although if it
 * wears off while being suppressed the effects of wearing off take place.
