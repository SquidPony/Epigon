    /* Castle notes from real castles
    Average thickness of stone wall: 2m but can be up to 15m

    Standard motte and bailey area: 0.12 square km

    Approximate largest stone keeps: 31m x 31m

    Motte and Bailey style usually had one of each but sometimes up to two
    Motte is a raised mound with a building on it for final defense
    Mottes were 5-15m high (just the earthen part, not including the building on top)
    Bailey is the larger, lower open area surrounded by a wall or pallisagde
    A drawbridge connected the bailey to the motte

    Shell Keeps were essentially a Bailey only with a stone wall instead of wooden pallisades

    Pleshey Castle (Motte & Bailey style, 1 each)
      - bailey is a kidney shape 190m x 90m
      - base of motte is 90m diameter
      - top of motte is 28m
      - motte is 15m high
      - had wood pallisades and buildings

    Malbork Castle
      - total area covered, including grounds outside walls: 12 square km

    Borl Castle (in Croatia)
      - walls thickness up to 12m

    Chepstow Castle (in Wales)
      - walls thickness is 6m
