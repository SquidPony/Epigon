/**
 * Grouping of qualities related to glow and light emission. When a Radiance variable in some object is null, it
 * means that object doesn't emit light; if a Radiance variable is non-null, it still might not emit light.  
 * This object has 4 fields:
 * <ul>
 * <li>range, how far the light extends; 0f is "just this cell"</li>
 * <li>color, the color of the light as a float; typically opaque and lighter than the glowing object's color</li>
 * <li>flicker, the rate of random continuous change to radiance range</li>
 * <li>strobe, the rate of non-random continuous change to radiance range</li>
 * </ul>
 * These all have defaults; if no parameters are specified the light will be white, affect only the current cell, and
 * won't flicker or strobe.
