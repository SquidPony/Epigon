 * Represents a modification to another object.
 *
 * This can be quite extensive, changing all features of the given object. It
 * can also change different features depending on the object type and item
 * interfaces implemented.
 *
 * For example, a modification of "Ice" might add certain resistances to a
 * creature and modify the liquidity of liquids.
