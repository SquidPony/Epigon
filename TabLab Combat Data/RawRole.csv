Assassin	A killer-for-hire who lurks in the shadows, then strikes with concealed weapons drawn in an instant.	Assassination	You have a high chance of enemies not noticing you when they otherwise would; this chance falls as Zone tension rises.
Brawler	A disciplined fighter who trains in both hand-to-hand combat and with various weapons.	Martial Arts	You deal more damage to enemies who are in a Power Burst and automatically counter their attacks.

Guardian	A cautious defender who prefers to use polearms and shields to keep foes at bay.	Foresight	You preemptive-counter all enemy Power Strikes when the attacker is in your attack range.
Hunter	A tireless tracker who stalks prey through the wild before striking with a so-called "primitive" weapon.	Naturalism	On even-numbered rounds, your attacks cannot be countered; while Zone Tension is low, you are immune to hazards.
Jester	A cackling comedian who gauges his foes at a distance before hurling an arsenal of thrown weapons.	Hurling	On odd-numbered rounds, you have a low chance to enter a Power Burst; this chance rises as Zone Tension rises.
Marksman	A quiet, calm sniper who is skilled with all forms of projectile weaponry, and uses it to great effect.	Marksmanship	You have a moderate chance for any attack you make to be a Power Strike; this chance falls as Zone Tension rises.

			A Power Burst is a 2-turn period where every attack a character makes is repeated once against the same target.
			A Power Strike is a single attack with doubled accuracy, damage, crit, and influence.
			Each area has a Zone Tension score that rises with each attack an NPC makes; various abilities rely on this.
