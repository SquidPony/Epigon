# Epigon

Under development, available for internal use primarily.

Currently, the "game" looks like:

Most of the interesting code here is either related to making
a text-based game using SquidLib look good, or related to
the... uh... rather complex system of procedural generation
used here. Epigon.java is pretty much a god class, but it
has a lot of the map-drawing code for the first goal. The 
data package, particularly squidpony.epigon.data.quality ,
has some interesting and unusual ways to handle content,
related to the second goal.
