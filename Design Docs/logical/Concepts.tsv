Rules Concept	Description
Turn-based Combat	Combat is split into turns, with limited reactions (always automatic) possible to another character's action.
Multiple PCs	There are multiple player-characters in a combat, each controlled directly on their turn.
Randomness	Most effects have a chance of success and many have variable amounts of effect that may occur upon success and/or failure; the chances are determined by seeded PRNGs and can be deterministic given the same player choices and starting seed.
Attacks	All characters in a combat are expected to be able to take some form of player-relevant action; all characters are capable of performing at least basic attacks, and many have other options.
Non-Attack Actions	Some characters can attempt to inflict status ailments on enemies or status augments on allies; others can cast spells to perform one of a variety of effects, some of which may be attacks.
Non-Action Effects	Some characters have auras that periodically make automatic attacks or attempts to inflict ailments on nearby cells; others have fields that apply a constant effect to nearby cells (usually only affecting allies).
Weapons	Many attacks are performed with an item used as a weapon; this requires a character to be able to wield that item (have enough hands free to hold the item, and some items have other prerequisites to be used as weapons).
Impromptu Weapons	Any item can be used as an impromptu weapon (including a weapon that a character can't normally use, like a firearm can be used as a club even if someone doesn't know how to fire one); these still require free hands.
Item Quantities	Some items may be measured in a volume, such as water or gunpowder, and that volume may affect how it responds to other events (in a fire, a very small amount of water evaporates instantly, while a larger amount boils).
Consumable Items	Some items are consumed by using them, rendering some amount of that item or its ammunition useless (like firing an arrow by attacking with a longbow destroys the arrow).
Grid	Combat takes place on a square 2D grid.
Abstract Size	Fitting with roguelike expectations, the physical size of a creature doesn't change how many grid cells it occupies.
Movement	Characters are expected to move multiple cells per turn, and different terrain can prevent movement for some characters (i.e. fish can't enter land tiles).
Push and Pull	Attacks may change the position of their target relative to the user, in a push away from the user or a pull toward the user; this needs to happen one cell at a time to avoid “skipping over” walls or obstacles.
Location Effects	Various qualities may be associated with groups of cells, and apply some change to creatures and/or objects on those cells (may be on a tick basis, such as once per 3 turns, or constant).
Opposition	Curses and similar effects may make a character opposed by his surroundings or equipment, causing normally innocuous terrain or item usage to become hazardous for that character.
